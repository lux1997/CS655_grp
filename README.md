# Readme
- This is a implementation of Image Recognition Application for BU CS655 GENI Project. The user is able to submit an image query from the web interface and the service will use image recognition technique, which classifies the image and returns the answer to the user.
- We implement this project using python, here ```client.py```, ```server.py```, ```classifier.py``` and ```index.html``` are all the code files. ```client.sh``` and ```server.sh``` are automated scripts to set up the dependencies on the server and client nodes. ```rspec.xml``` is the Rspec files to reserve resources on GENI. And folder ```data``` includes files needed for the classifier model.
